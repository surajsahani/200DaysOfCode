/*
 * The smallest subset
 * 
 * Your are given a array A. You are required to slect the smallest subset of
 * array such that the bitwise OR, of values of elements in the subset is maximum
 * 
 * NOTE : The subset cannot be empty
 * 
 * Input format
 * 1. The first line contains T that denotes the number of test cases.
 * 2. The first of each test cases contains an integer , N that denotes the elements of the array.
 * 3. The second line of each test case contains 
      N space-separated integers that denotes the elements of the array.
 
 * Output format
 *
 * For each test case, print a single corresponding to the size of the
 * smallest subset that results in maximum bitwise OR value in a new line. 
 *
 *Constraints
 *
 * 1<=T<=3
 * 1<=N<=10^5
 * 1<=A[i] <= 10^6
