/*
 * Given an unsorted array, you have to delete an element such that after deletion every subset of the array having min & max element in increasing order(a similar approach like window sliding )

Time complexity O(n^2)

Eg:

arr[]={2,3,4,5,1,6,7};
delete(1)
after deletion 
(2,3) 
(2,3,4)
(2,3,4,5)
and so on..
In this, Some corner case must be kept in mind while solving the question
